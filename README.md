# Medium Clone using Sanity, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

Project is deployed [Here]()

This is a Medium clone web application which is created by following Youtube Video [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/6fNy0iD3hsk) built with the following technologies:

- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - Headless CMS for managing content
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Superset of JavaScript for adding static types
- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly

The purpose of this project was to learn about Next.js, TypeScript.

Project taught me about:

- How to create Next.js web apps
- How to use Typescript(.tsx) in Next.js
- What is Sanity and use of Sanity
- How to use Tailwind CSS
- Gained confidence to build more projects
